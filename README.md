# AiryscanCZIs_To_Tiffs
Takes Airyscan-Processed .czi files, enhances the contrast, and converts them to tiffs.

This macro was written in March 2024 to help Cherrelle Dacon convert her Airyscan-processed czi files into tifs.
The macro will take all Airyscan-processed czi files in the input folder, enhance the contrast based on the
middle slice, and save them as tiffs.
