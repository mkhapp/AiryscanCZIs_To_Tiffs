# AiryscanCZIs_To_Tiffs
Takes Airyscan-Processed .czi files, enhances the contrast, and converts them to tiffs.

This macro was written in March 2024 to help Cherrelle Dacon convert her Airyscan-processed czi files into tifs.
The macro will take all Airyscan-processed czi files in the input folder, enhance the contrast based on the
middle slice, and save them as tiffs.

Two other macros have been added that were used in July 2024 to help Hyeseon Cho convert unprocessed Airyscan
images into jpeg figures.
